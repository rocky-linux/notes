4) easy switching between doc. to various versions of RL ( good model: 
https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/
 - I can select version from dropdown above, and also google for doc. for specific versions)
17:26
5) "Playtesters" to go through documentation and try to replicate results
6) Setting expectations of prior knowledge before going through documentation
7) Technical approving vs style/grammar approving

8)  Feedback
17:31

9) Public comments by readers (e.g. to report typo, etc.)? Maybe belongs to feedback 8).
10) List of doc. target groups. And consider who is the main target group. Probably not newbie, but experienced sysadmin who needs CentOS replacement. Maybe there may be several parallel documentation projects serving different target groups.

11) Simplified english version

15) Embedded verified videos, also from third parties.
Guys, after product documentation topic, I have yet different documentation topic: project history documentation. I would also like to share screen with you after we finish with current topic ...

And I have a question about the (potential) style guide.
16) Friendly, writing-for-actual-people writing style for beginner docs.
18:03
17) Add built static site to ISO

17a) ... with warning that it may be outdated, containing link to online version.

Ooooh, good point.
I mean, docs could get patched with OS updates, but still.

18) Repo location: 
learn.rockylinux.org
 -> 
docs.rockylinux.org
19) RL docs versioning (8->9, ...)
18:11
Richard Ostrochovsk√Ω
19) = 4) ?
about versioning: 2 things to differentiate: versions of documentation and versions of product being documented
18:13

10) Versioning for different Rocky versions 8 -->  9 ---> 10... ??
18:16
Richard Ostrochovsk√Ω
10a) I meant e.g. 1. technical documentation (for every version, of course) for sysadmins - this is probably the main point, 2. howto pages for "newbies", 3. video courses on YT, ... just examples of parallel "documentation projects" which need not to be done by the same team, but parallel teams
