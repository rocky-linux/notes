# Documentation Team Meeting
## January 4, 2021


1) Make a style guide for contributions. 

2) Make fewer assumptions about skill level of readers - write for newer-to-Linux/newer-to-admin users. 

3) Include many examples in the documentation. 

4) Enable switching of documentation versions between Rocky Linux versions: see https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/

5) Designate "Playtesters" to go through documentation step-by-step and try to replicate results

6) Set expectations of prior knowledge before going through documentation (cf 2)

7) Designate technical approving (documentation content) vs style/grammar approving (documentation style)

8) Add a channel for feedback on the documentation. 

9) Implement public comments by readers (to report typos, etc.) (cf 8)

9a) Public comments integration with Mattermost (IRC, Matrix ...).

10) List documentation target groups, and consider who is the main target group. Probably not newbies, but experienced sysadmins who need CentOS replacement. Maybe, there may be several parallel documentation projects serving different target groups.

10a) Versioning for different Rocky versions 8 -->  9 ---> 10... ??

10b) Include 

1. technical documentation (for every version, of course) for sysadmins - this is probably the main point, 
2. howto pages for "newbies", 
3. video courses on YT, ... just examples of parallel "documentation projects" which need not to be done by the same team, but parallel teams

11) Simplified english version of the documentation for non-native speakers. 

12) Set up a meeting to go over Hugo? (Partially addressed in meeting)

13) Summarize meeting notes, next steps, and timeline/release dates (e.g. add to this document)

14) Implement example terminal? I.e. place to try commands listed on documentation in a cloud machine: see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/

15) Embedded verified videos, also from third parties.

16) Friendly, writing-for-actual-people writing style for beginner docs.

17) Add built static site to ISO

17a) ... with warning that it may be outdated, containing link to online version.

18) Set repo location: learn.rockylinux.org -> docs.rockylinux.org

19) RL docs versioning (8->9, ...) (cf 4)

19a) Differentiate versions of documentation from versions of product being documented
